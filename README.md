Google analytics capstone project: Cyclistic Bikeshare case study

About the Case Study
This is about a bike share company (Cyclistic) in Chicago features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. 
The Cyclistic company have two types of bike users, casual riders and annual members. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
Here my role is to involve the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic as a junior analyst and address the question;
“How casual riders differ from member rides?”
This analysis is based on Cyclistic rider data from  September 2020 to August 2021.
